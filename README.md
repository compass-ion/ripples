## Ripples: Purposeful Brainstorming

This is a simple project I’m doing to learn the basics of coding in Python.

The goal is to share a straightforward method to help you understand any topic better.

Here’s how it works:

1.) Choose a Topic:  
Start by picking a topic and writing it in the center of a blank page. 
Draw a circle around it. This represents your initial understanding of the topic.

2.) Add Subtopics:  
Think of 2 to 7 related subtopics and arrange them around the center topic. 
Draw circles around each subtopic and a larger circle around all of them. 
This creates your first ripple.

3.) Find Connections:  
Pick two neighboring subtopics and explore how they are related. 
Keep doing this until you’ve connected all neighboring pairs. 
Draw a circle around these connections. This is your second ripple.

4.) Keep Exploring:  
Continue finding connections between subtopics until you’ve explored all of them. 
Each new set of connections creates another ripple.

In the end, the process will naturally result in the same number of ripples as 
the number of subtopics you chose inside the first ripple.

By following these steps, you’ll create a visual map of your knowledge about the topic. 
Once you finish, you might discover a new perspective or learn something new!
